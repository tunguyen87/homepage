My research interests span computer vision, machine learning, big data analysis, and data mining. I am particularly interested in probabilistic approaches and theoretical algorithms for high-impact societal applications in image/video understanding, such as image retrieval, image annotation, and human activity analysis. I am also interested in how to build and productionize machine learning applications with distributed algorithms on Big Data platforms.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the Kyung Hee University in 2018. Before starting Ph.D., I received the B.S. degree in 2010 at Electronics and Telecommunications, Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, Vietnam. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering and Digital Sciences, Nazarbayev University. Prior to joining Nazarbayev University, I have been a postdoctoral fellow at Data Knowledge Engineering Lab, Kyung Hee University.
